# Specification
This' my own specification to help myself the building
of REST API clients using the Retrofit2 library.
Example in usage you can find on [u004/kreedz-sdk][kreedz-sdk].
That whole project built using these help-classes in the base
to maintain high-standard flexibility in using it in your own projects.
